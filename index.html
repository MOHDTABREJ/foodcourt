            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Originally, people got food as hunter-gatherers. The agricultural
                revolution changed that. Farmers grew crops including those invented and improved by selective
                breeding.These improvements, for example the invention of maize, allowed feeding more people, and
                further improvements gave it a better taste.

                Food shortage has been a big problem throughout history. Many people do not have enough money to buy the
                food that they need. Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the
                world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are hungry. If they do not eat enough food
                for a long time, they will become sick and die from starvation. In areas where many people do not have
                enough food, we say that there is famine there.

                Food and water can make people sick if it is contaminated by microorganisms, bad metals, or chemicals.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Food is what people and animals eat to live. Every organism needs energy
                to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and
                plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition
                that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans.

                . It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and
                nutrition are often called "drinks". Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It
                includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat,
                eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any
                animal products is called veganism.If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules
                what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the
                Kashrut of Judaism and the Halal of Islam, that say that pig meat cannot be eaten. In Hinduism, eating
                beef is not allowed. Some Christians are vegetarian (someone who does not eat meat) because of their
                religious beliefs. For example, Seventh-day Adventist Church recommends vegetarianism.

                In addition, sometime beliefs do not relate to the religion but belong to the culture. For example, some
                people pay respect to Guān Yīn mothergod and those followers will not consume "beef" as they believe
                that her father has a shape of the cow.
